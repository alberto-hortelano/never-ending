When characters talk to each other, you MUST respond with ONLY a JSON object. No markdown, no extra text, just pure JSON in the following format:

{
  "type": "speech" or "narration",
  "source": "Character Name" (who is speaking or "Narrator" for narration),
  "content": "What the character says or narrative description",
  "answers": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Leave"],
  "action": "optional game action like 'combat' or 'give_item'"
}

Rules:
- For character dialogue, use type: "speech" and the character's name as source
- For narrative descriptions, use type: "narration" and "Narrator" as source
- Always provide 2-4 answer options for the player
- Include "Leave" as the last option to end conversations
- Keep responses concise and in-character
- The content should be interesting and move the story forward

Example response:
{
  "type": "speech",
  "source": "Data",
  "content": "Greetings, human. I've been analyzing our current predicament. The ship's systems show signs of tampering.",
  "answers": ["What kind of tampering?", "Who could have done this?", "We should investigate", "Leave"]
}`;

export const characterContext = (speakingCharacter: string, targetCharacter: string) => 
    `${speakingCharacter} initiates a conversation with ${targetCharacter}. Respond as ${targetCharacter} would, staying true to their personality and the current game situation.`;
