# Performance Optimization Suggestions

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Object Pooling
**Problem:** Frequent creation and destruction of objects (cells, corridors, characters) causes garbage collection pressure.

**Solution:**
- Implement object pools for frequently created objects
- Reuse Cell components when map changes instead of recreating
- Pool Corridor objects in map generation
- Pool animation state objects

**Implementation Example:**
```typescript
class ObjectPool<T> {
    private pool: T[] = [];
    private create: () => T;
    private reset: (obj: T) => void;

    get(): T {
        return this.pool.pop() || this.create();
    }

    release(obj: T): void {
        this.reset(obj);
        this.pool.push(obj);
    }
}
```

### 2. Lazy Loading for Large Maps
**Problem:** Loading entire map data at once can block the UI for large maps.

**Solution:**
- Implement viewport-based loading
- Only load and render visible cells plus a buffer zone
- Stream map data as player moves

### 3. Web Workers for Map Generation
**Problem:** Map generation blocks the main thread, causing UI freezes.

**Solution:**
- Move map generation algorithms to Web Worker
- Use transferable objects for efficient data passing
- Show loading indicator during generation

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// mapWorker.ts
self.onmessage = (e) => {
    const { rooms, seed } = e.data;
    const map = generateMap(rooms, seed);
    self.postMessage({ map }, [map.buffer]);
};
```

### 4. Computed Value Caching
**Problem:** Repeatedly calculating same values (room positions, corridor paths).

**Solution:**
- Cache computation results with invalidation strategy
- Use WeakMap for component-specific caches
- Implement memoization for pure functions

## Memory Optimizations

### 1. Event Listener Cleanup
**Problem:** Memory leaks from unremoved event listeners.

**Solution:**
- Implement proper cleanup in disconnectedCallback
- Use AbortController for batch listener removal
- Track active listeners per component

### 2. WeakMap for Component Data
**Problem:** Strong references prevent garbage collection.

**Solution:**
```typescript
const componentData = new WeakMap<Component, ComponentData>();
// Data automatically garbage collected when component is removed
```

### 3. Proper Disposal Patterns
**Problem:** Services and large objects not properly cleaned up.

**Solution:**
- Implement IDisposable interface
- Clear references in destroy methods
- Use weak references where appropriate

## Rendering Optimizations

### 1. Batch DOM Updates
**Problem:** Multiple DOM updates cause reflows and repaints.

**Solution:**
- Already implemented with requestAnimationFrame
- Consider using DocumentFragment for bulk inserts
- Group style changes to minimize reflows

### 2. CSS Transforms for Animations
**Problem:** Position changes trigger layout recalculation.

**Solution:**
- Use transform: translate() instead of top/left
- Use will-change for frequently animated properties
- Leverage GPU acceleration with transform3d

### 3. Virtual DOM or Reactive Framework
**Problem:** Manual DOM manipulation is error-prone and inefficient.

**Solution (Long-term):**
- Consider migrating to a reactive framework (Vue, React, Svelte)
- Implement virtual DOM diffing for complex UI updates
- Use reactive state management

### 4. Dirty Checking for State Updates
**Problem:** Unnecessary re-renders when state hasn't actually changed.

**Solution:**
- Implement dirty flags for state sections
- Only dispatch events when values actually change
- Use immutable data structures for easy comparison

## Network Optimizations

### 1. Delta Compression for Multiplayer
**Problem:** Sending full state updates uses excessive bandwidth.

**Solution:**
- Send only changed fields
- Implement state diffing algorithm
- Use binary protocol for smaller payloads

### 2. Request Batching
**Problem:** Multiple sequential API calls increase latency.

**Solution:**
- Batch multiple requests into single call
- Implement request queue with debouncing
- Use GraphQL or similar for flexible data fetching

## Code Structure Optimizations

### 1. Tree Shaking
**Problem:** Unused code increases bundle size.

**Solution:**
- Use ES modules consistently
- Avoid side effects in module initialization
- Configure webpack for aggressive tree shaking

### 2. Code Splitting
**Problem:** Large initial bundle delays first paint.

**Solution:**
- Split code by routes/features
- Lazy load components on demand
- Use dynamic imports for heavy features

### 3. Bundle Size Optimization
**Problem:** Large JavaScript bundles slow down loading.

**Solution:**
- Analyze bundle with webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives
- Implement progressive enhancement

## Algorithmic Optimizations

### 1. Spatial Indexing for Collision Detection
**Problem:** O(nÂ²) collision checks for many entities.

**Solution:**
- Implement quadtree or spatial hash
- Only check nearby entities
- Cache collision results per frame

### 2. Pathfinding Optimization
**Problem:** A* pathfinding can be expensive for long paths.

**Solution:**
- Implement hierarchical pathfinding
- Cache common paths
- Use jump point search for grid-based maps

### 3. View Frustum Culling
**Problem:** Processing invisible entities wastes CPU.

**Solution:**
- Only update entities in viewport
- Implement level-of-detail (LOD) system
- Skip animations for off-screen characters

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Quick Wins)
1. Event listener cleanup
2. Remove remaining console.logs
3. Batch DOM updates
4. CSS transform animations

### Medium Priority (Moderate Effort)
1. Object pooling for cells
2. Computed value caching
3. Web Worker for map generation
4. Dirty checking for state

### Low Priority (Major Refactoring)
1. Virtual DOM implementation
2. Spatial indexing system
3. Progressive web app features
4. Framework migration

## Monitoring and Profiling

### Performance Metrics to Track
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Frame rate during animations
- Memory usage over time
- Network request waterfall

### Tools for Profiling
- Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- React DevTools Profiler (if migrating)
- Lighthouse for overall performance
- webpack-bundle-analyzer for bundle size

## Notes

These optimizations should be implemented gradually, with performance testing before and after each change. Start with high-priority items that provide immediate benefits with minimal risk. Always profile before optimizing to ensure you're addressing actual bottlenecks rather than perceived ones.
