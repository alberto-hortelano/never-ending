## Core Strategic Principles

### Action Economy
The faction that takes more effective actions wins:
- **Eliminate enemies** reduces their actions
- **Preserve characters** maintains your actions
- **Efficient AP usage** maximizes actions per turn
- **Force inefficiency** make enemies waste AP

### Positioning Over Firepower
Good positioning beats superior weapons:
- Control key terrain
- Maintain sight lines
- Deny enemy movement
- Create kill zones

### Information Warfare
Knowledge is power:
- Scout before committing
- Track enemy AP usage
- Predict enemy movements
- Hide your intentions

**Cons**: AP intensive, risky

### Defensive Opening
Establish strong defensive line:
1. Take nearest good cover
2. Set up interlocking overwatch
3. Wait for enemy approach

### Balanced Opening
