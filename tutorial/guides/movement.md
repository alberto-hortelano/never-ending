## Basic Movement

### How to Move
1. **Select a Character** - Click on your character to select them
2. **Choose Destination** - Click on a highlighted hex to move there
3. **Confirm Path** - The game will show the movement path before executing

### Movement Costs
Every movement action consumes Action Points (AP):
- **Normal Terrain**: 10 AP per hex
- **Difficult Terrain**: 15-20 AP per hex
- **Elevation Changes**: +5 AP when moving uphill
- **Sprint Mode**: Double movement speed, but costs 2x AP

## Movement Types

### Walk
- **Cost**: 10-15 AP per hex
- **Range**: Limited by remaining AP
- **Best For**: Careful positioning, conserving AP

### Sprint
- **Cost**: 20-30 AP per hex  
- **Range**: Can cover more ground quickly
- **Best For**: Reaching objectives, escaping danger
- **Drawback**: Uses AP rapidly, may leave you exposed

### Tactical Advance
- **Cost**: 15 AP per hex
- **Range**: Shorter than normal movement
- **Benefit**: Maintains defensive stance
- **Best For**: Moving through dangerous areas

## Terrain Effects

### Open Ground
- Standard movement cost
- No cover bonus
- Full visibility

### Cover Positions
- Normal movement cost to enter
- Provides defensive bonuses
- May block some movement paths

### Elevated Positions
- Extra AP cost to climb
- Provides shooting advantages
- Better visibility

### Obstacles
- Cannot move through
- Must path around
- Can provide cover

## Movement Strategy

### Positioning Principles
1. **Always end in cover** - Never finish movement in the open
2. **Consider AP reserves** - Keep some AP for reactions
3. **Control sightlines** - Move to positions with good visibility
4. **Plan escape routes** - Always have a fallback position

### Common Movement Patterns

#### Leapfrogging
Move characters in alternating turns to maintain covering fire:
1. Character A moves to new position
2. Character A provides overwatch
3. Character B advances past Character A
4. Repeat pattern

#### Flanking
Circle around enemy positions:
1. One unit suppresses from front
2. Another unit moves around the side
3. Attack from unexpected angle

#### Tactical Withdrawal
Retreat while maintaining defense:
1. Set overwatch with rear character
2. Move front character back
3. Alternate positions while retreating

## Advanced Movement Tips

### AP Management
- **First Move**: Scout with cheap movements
- **Mid Turn**: Position for attacks
- **End Turn**: Ensure defensive positioning

### Movement Prediction
- Enemies follow similar movement rules
- Predict where enemies might move
- Block key movement paths
- Control chokepoints

### Combined Arms
- Coordinate movement with team
- Support advancing allies
- Create crossfire zones
- Maintain unit spacing

## Movement Indicators

### Visual Cues
- **Blue Hexes**: Available movement
- **Yellow Hexes**: Sprint range
- **Red Hexes**: Blocked or enemy controlled
- **Green Path**: Selected movement route

### AP Display

The AP display shows:
- Current AP remaining
- Cost of selected movement
- AP after movement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving too far** - Exhausting all AP leaves you vulnerable
2. **Ignoring elevation** - Height advantage is significant
3. **Bunching up** - Makes your team vulnerable to area attacks
4. **Predictable patterns** - Vary your movement to stay unpredictable
5. **Forgetting overwatch** - Enemy overwatch can interrupt movement

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Efficient Pathing
- Start at one corner of the map
- Reach the opposite corner using minimum AP
- Stay in cover for at least 50% of hexes

### Exercise 2: Bounding Overwatch
- Use two characters
- Move across open ground
- One always covering the other
- Never have both exposed simultaneously

### Exercise 3: Flanking Maneuver
- Identify an enemy position
- Plan a route to attack from side
- Execute without being seen
- Coordinate with ally distraction
