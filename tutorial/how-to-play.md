The game interface consists of:
- **Game Board**: The hexagonal grid where characters move and fight

- **Top Bar**: Shows game information and settings
- **Bottom Bar**: Contains action buttons and turn controls

## Game Concepts

### Action Points (AP)
Every turn, you have **100 Action Points** to spend on various actions:
- **Movement**: Costs 10-20 AP per hex depending on terrain
- **Shooting**: Typically costs 25 AP
- **Aiming**: Costs 10 AP to improve accuracy
- **Other Actions**: Various costs for special abilities

### Turn-Based Combat
- Each player takes turns controlling their characters
- Plan your moves carefully to maximize your AP usage
- Turns end when you click "End Turn" or run out of AP

### Line of Sight
- You need clear line of sight to shoot at enemies
- Obstacles and terrain can block shots
- Position matters for both offense and defense

## Movement and Actions

### Moving Characters
1. Click on your character to select them
2. Click on a destination hex to move
3. Valid movement paths will be highlighted
4. Movement cost is deducted from your AP

### Available Actions
Actions vary based on your character and equipment:
- **Move**: Basic movement across the battlefield
- **Sprint**: Faster movement that costs more AP
- **Shoot**: Fire at enemies within range
- **Aim**: Improve accuracy before shooting
- **Overwatch**: Set up defensive fire position
- **Melee Attack**: Close combat strikes

## Combat

### Shooting Mechanics
1. Select the "Shoot" action
2. Choose your target
3. The game calculates hit probability based on:
   - Distance to target
   - Cover and obstacles
   - Character skills
   - Previous aiming actions

### Tactical Considerations
- **Cover**: Always try to end turns behind cover
- **Flanking**: Attack enemies from multiple angles
- **AP Management**: Save some AP for defensive actions
- **Range**: Different weapons have different effective ranges

## Strategy Tips

### Basic Strategy
1. **Control the High Ground**: Height advantage improves shooting
2. **Use Cover Effectively**: Minimize exposure to enemy fire
3. **Coordinate Attacks**: Focus fire on single targets
4. **Manage Resources**: Don't waste all AP on movement

### Advanced Tactics
- **Overwatch Traps**: Set up crossfire zones (see [Overwatch Guide](guides/overwatch.md))
- **Flanking Maneuvers**: Force enemies out of cover (see [Movement Guide](guides/movement.md))
- **AP Conservation**: Save AP for reaction shots (see [Actions Guide](guides/actions.md))
- **Terrain Usage**: Use obstacles to block enemy movement
